# Python PW Mask

Python PW Mask is a tool designed to enhance security by masking passwords during user input. It provides additional functionality to enforce strong password protocols, generate one-time temporary passwords, and ensure that all passwords are entered securely, whether in masked or visible form, based on user preference.

## Features

- **Masking Password Input**: Masks password during entry to protect sensitive information.
- **Temporary Password Generation**: Generates a temporary password that expires after one session or a set time limit.
- **Enhanced Security Measures**: Enforces password changes and provides options for increased password complexity and two-factor authentication (2FA) setup reminders.
