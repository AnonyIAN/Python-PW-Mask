# Python PW Mask

Python PW Mask is a tool designed to enhance security by masking passwords during user input. It provides additional functionality to enforce strong password protocols, generate one-time temporary passwords, and ensure that all passwords are entered securely, whether in masked or visible form, based on user preference. This tool can be easily integrated with other Python-based security tools to enhance overall security measures.

## Features

- **Masking Password Input**: This feature masks the password during entry to protect sensitive information. It uses a mix of symbols and numbers to increase security.
- **Temporary Password Generation**: This function generates a temporary password that expires after one session or a set time limit, promoting secure access management.
- **Enhanced Security Measures**: Enforces password changes and provides options for increased password complexity. It also includes potential integrations with log management and compliance monitoring systems.
- User-Controlled Masking Options: This powerful feature allows users to choose whether their password is masked during input, with added warnings and security measures for unmasked entries. This level of control empowers security professionals, giving them the reassurance that their security measures are in their hands.
