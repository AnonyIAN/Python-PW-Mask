# Python PW Mask

Python PW Mask is a tool designed to enhance security by masking passwords during user input. It provides additional functionality to enforce strong password protocols, generate one-time temporary passwords, and ensure that all passwords are entered securely, whether in masked or visible form, based on user preference. This tool can be easily integrated with other Python-based security tools to enhance overall security measures.

## Features

- **Masking Password Input:** Protects sensitive information by masking passwords during entry using a mix of symbols and numbers.
- **Temporary Password Generation:** Generates a temporary password that expires after one session or a set time limit, promoting secure access management.
- **Enhanced Security Measures:** Enforces password changes, offers increased password complexity options, and potential integrations with log management and compliance monitoring systems.
- **User-Controlled Masking Options:** Allows users to choose whether their password is masked during input, with added warnings and security measures for unmasked entries. This feature gives security professionals control and reassurance over their security measures.
